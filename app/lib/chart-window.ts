/**
 * How far back each chart timeframe asks for.
 *
 * The original table gave every timeframe roughly one screenful of bars —
 * 2h of 1-minute bars, 8h of 5-minute bars, and so on, ~96-180 bars each.
 * That is the right shape for a market that trades continuously, and the
 * wrong one for this playground, where a market may trade a handful of times
 * a day. A window sized in BARS is really a window sized in *expected trade
 * frequency*, and these markets do not meet it.
 *
 * Measured on the live playground (SOL-PERP, the only devnet market with real
 * trades) while diagnosing a chart reported as "one line, or nothing":
 *
 *   timeframe   shipped window   bars returned   all-time bars
 *   1m          2h               none            6
 *   5m          8h               1               5
 *   15m         24h              1               5
 *
 * The data was there the whole time; the window excluded it. Its most recent
 * 1-minute bar was 2.6h old against a 2.0h window. "One line" was literally a
 * single bar, and the near-empty result then tripped the <10-bar threshold in
 * TradingChart, which silently swapped the market's own trades for an
 * external spot series — so the chart could look fine, wrong, or empty
 * depending on whether the token happened to have one.
 *
 * So the windows are sized by what they must CATCH rather than by how many
 * bars a liquid market would fill them with. The bar ceilings below are the
 * cost of that, and are kept within what the renderer handles comfortably.
