/**
 * Deposit-amount guard: an amount above the wallet's collateral balance must
 * be caught in the UI (inline error + disabled submit) AND in the hook (a
 * programmatic call must not build a tx above the balance).
 *
 * Why this exists. The wrapper's Deposit ix rejects `amount > source token
 * balance` on-chain (`require_token_balance`, no clamp) and the stake / LP
 * vault transfers are plain SPL transfers, so an over-balance deposit can
 * never move MORE than the wallet holds. The reported "went through as if I
 * had that much" was a SILENT CLAMP in the order-ticket "Start Trading"
 * starter deposit (OrderTicket clamped to the balance, then `useInitUser`
 * clamped again) while the input kept showing the oversized number. Withdraw
 * already tells the user ("Withdrawal amount exceeds ..."); deposit now does
 * the same instead of quietly depositing less than what was typed.
