/**
 * UX WP-4 (audit §3.6, user decision 2026-09-30): Earn withdrawal as ONE flow over two
 * signatures. The redemption cooldown stays (a cooldown of 0 lets a leaver front-run a loss onto
 * the seniors who stay), so:
 *   request (76) -> "Withdrawal in progress: X USDC · Ready in m:ss" -> when the cooldown ends,
 *   the payout (77, pre-simulated, repairs bundled by sendTx) opens by itself; after a reload the
 *   card says "Finish withdrawal". Only a vault whose cooldown is 0 withdraws in one tx [76, 77].
 *
 * Pricing: during a price catch-up the wrapper (ede691b6) prices Earn exits / entries at the
 * worse of the effective and the pending target price; the ONE port of that rule is
 * lib/limits/earn-pricing.ts `earnSeniorPricing`, and every preview here consumes its output.
 * Pure; unit-tested in __tests__/lib/limits/earn-withdraw.test.ts.
