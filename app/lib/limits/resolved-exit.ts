/**
 * Earn senior exit after a market RESOLVES (P3 424fe7e4; F-4 + P3-H1 + F-8).
 *
 * ExecuteRedemption (77) in Resolved mode needs a TERMINAL-FLAT market:
 * `materialized_portfolio_count == 0 && c_tot == 0` (`handle_execute_redemption`, #377). One
 * walked-away trader used to lock every Earn depositor (F-4). The program now lets ANYONE
 * finish the market, and this module plans that sweep from decoded state:
 *
 *   vault LP (bound):  101 VaultLpSettleResolved(0) [+ 101(1) while its payout receipt is
 *                      unfinalized]  ->  8 ClosePortfolio with owner = registry PDA
 *   each trader:       30 CloseResolved (permissionless after force_close_delay_slots; pays the
 *                      OWNER's ATA)  ->  46 top-up while its receipt is unfinalized  ->
 *                      8 ClosePortfolio (F-4: any signer, rent to the owner)
 *
 * The vault LP goes first: a winning trader's resolved close is progress-only until its losing
 * counterparty (the vault LP) has settled (P3 final pass). The emptiness test here is the
 * subset of the engine's `is_empty_for_dematerialization` the app can decode; close-progress
 * and source-domain slots are not decoded, so every step is simulated before it is sent and a
 * refused step is reported, never retried blindly.
 *
 * Pure: no RPC. `useResolvedExit` feeds it and executes the plan.
