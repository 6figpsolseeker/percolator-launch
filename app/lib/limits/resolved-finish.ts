/**
 * UX WP-8 (audit §3.9, RX-1): "Finish now" in ONE approval.
 *
 * Every step that can finish the market is planned up front from the decoded portfolios, and the
 * steps the program may need to REPEAT (101 SettleVaultLpResolved, 30 CloseResolved are chunked)
 * are pre-signed in several copies with distinct compute-unit prices (so each copy has its own
 * signature). The whole list is signed with one signAllCompat. The driver then broadcasts in order,
 * re-reading the market before each transaction and skipping any copy whose step is no longer
 * needed — unneeded copies are NEVER broadcast (AC4). The user's own Earn request (76) can ride at
 * the end, so the withdrawal's pending card (WP-4) takes it from there.
 * Pure planning + an injected driver (no RPC here).
