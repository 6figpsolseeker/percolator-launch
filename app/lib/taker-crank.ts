/**
 * Should a trade/close be preceded by a PermissionlessCrank on the TAKER's own portfolio?
 *
 * useTrade used to PREPEND that crank to the trade, in the same transaction, whenever the
 * taker had an active leg. Measured on devnet (2026-10-01, wrapper bd4fe5f8, a fresh
 * non-creator wallet, the app's own builders, 12 rounds per market): the trade ALONE
 * simulated clean 72/72, while crank + trade in ONE tx failed the trade with Custom(21)
 * EngineLockActive on most rounds (PERC long 9/12, short 10/12; SI long 10/12). 21 is a
 * "waitable" refusal, so the ticket sat on "Waiting for the latest price" for every trader
 * holding a position: adds, flips and closes (useClosePosition goes through trade()).
 *
 * WHY (engine 35ddd692 / wrapper bd4fe5f8): a crank carrying an asset-0 hint copies the
 * keeper's latest mark into `asset.raw_oracle_target_price` (wrapper v16_program.rs:23460 ->
 * engine v16.rs:14643) but may only walk `effective_price` toward it by
 * max_price_move_bps_per_slot x dt (wrapper :9279/:9298; dt is often 0-2 slots right after
 * the keeper's crank). A risk-increasing trade then hits the engine's intended
 * target/effective-lag guard: `asset_has_target_effective_lag` (engine :16556,
 * raw != effective) -> `trade_preflight_risk_gate` (engine :22593-22603) -> LockActive -> 21.
 * Without our crank raw == effective (PushAuthMark never writes raw), so the trade passes.
 * The lag clears only when a LATER crank's walk reaches the target. Upstream has the same gate.
 *
 * So the crank is never put in the trade's transaction. The trade path refreshes and
 * recertifies both portfolios itself (engine :18156-18173); a taker crank only helps when
 * the trade alone is refused with EngineStale (19) or EngineBStale (20) (wrapper pre-check
 * :31132-31170, portfolios with 8+ active legs, or a pending B-chunk) AND the crank alone
 * simulates clean. Only then is it sent, as a SEPARATE prior transaction; the trade is then
 * simulated afresh by sendTx as usual. A lagging engine clock is not this path's
 * job: lib/self-heal.ts catches it up by cranking the market's LP, and only keeps those
 * cranks when the healed list simulates without a repairable refusal.
