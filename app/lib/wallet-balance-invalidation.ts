/**
 * "The connected wallet's token balance just changed" — sent by the faucets, read by the
 * components that gate on the wallet's collateral balance (DepositWithdrawCard's "Create
 * Account", OrderTicket's "Get Tokens to Trade"). Each of those reads the balance once in an
 * effect, and a faucet claim changed none of their deps, so a funded wallet kept reading 0
 * ("Get tokens first") until a reload.
 *
 * Same module-level pattern as lib/portfolio-invalidation.ts (which is for the on-chain
 * portfolio and triggers a full scan, so it is not reused here), with the same follow-up
 * offsets: /api/rpc caches getTokenAccountBalance for 1s, so an immediate re-read can return
 * the pre-claim balance.
